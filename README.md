This web application is built for school assignment where we had to make web app of somekind on java using JSP/Servlets.

<h2>How to get this app working</h2>

1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. Import the project to IDE, for example Eclipse
3. Modify the Provider interface and add your database connection details, should be enough although there might be some customisation needed depending on your setup.
4. Enjoy

I could also upload this project to a server (ex. Heroku or Digitalocean), might do this in future. For now I will continue developing on Java Spring, this was a cool to see how things run on JSP/Servlets without the additional layers of abstraction provided by Spring framework.
